Udacity Front-End Web Dev Arcade Game
==== using HTML5 Canvas and OOJS ====
=====================================

In this Frogger-style arcade game, use the up/down/right/left arrows to control the player
across the board, with the goal of collecting all gems to advance each level.  As the 
level advances, more and faster enemy bugs appear.  Collect the star, available in higher
levels, to render the bugs harmless.

See how high of a score you can get, and how many levels you can advance to!

Good Luck!

Oh yeah hit 'p' for pause.
